We designed the adidas Superstar shoe back in the '70s, 
but it was the creators of the world who built its legacy. 
The athletes. The artists. The fashionistas. 
Everyone who wears them adds their unique voice to the 
collective history. This pair stays true to all the iconic 
elements, from the rubber shell toe to the serrated 3-Stripes, 
but adds pops of paisley to give it a fresh edge. Lace in, 
and leave your own mark.
